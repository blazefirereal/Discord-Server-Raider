# Discord Server Raider

**Important:** This tool is designed for educational purposes only. Using it to spam or raid Discord servers violates Discord’s Terms of Service (ToS) and can result in a account ban.

## Overview

This script automates the process of spamming Discord channels using multiple Discord accounts.

## How to Download

1. Navigate to the `Code` button on the repository page.
2. Select **Download ZIP** to download the repository.
3. Extract the ZIP file to your preferred directory.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Discord Accounts:** Set up as many Discord accounts as needed for the raid. The more accounts you make is the more chaos.
2. **Obtain Tokens:** After creating the accounts, gather their tokens. Save each token on a new line in a text file.
3. **Add Accounts to Server:** Ensure that all accounts are members of the target server. Avoid servers with active auto-moderation systems to reduce the risk of detection and bans.

## How to Start the Raid

1. Open `main.py` in a Python environment.
2. Run the script. You will be prompted to enter:
   - The message you want to spam.
   - The channel ID where the messages will be sent. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLWtSHWKbAI) for instructions on copying a channel ID. Note that this YouTube video is not owned or controlled by me, and its content is subject to change.
